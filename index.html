    <p>Breast cancer is a condition where abnormal cells in the breast multiply uncontrollably, forming tumors. If not treated, these tumors can spread to other parts of the body and become life-threatening. The earliest stage, known as 'in situ,' is not fatal and can often be detected early. Cancer cells invade nearby breast tissue and can form lumps or areas of thickening. Invasive breast cancers may spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant organs, a process called metastasis, which can be severe and potentially fatal.</p
